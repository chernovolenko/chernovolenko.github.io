Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Pavlo Chernovolenko and I enjoy creating native iOS apps since 2014. Developing a solid and smooth user experiences utilising standard Apple's frameworks is my hobby, which I would like to share with you here. Apple platform is a great foundation for creating top edge apps, keeping the code simple, readable and well maintainable. Here I'm posting my routine observations as well as useful tips and tricks that worked well for me.

You may also see some project analytics, charts and infographics drafts here. Being a fan of infographics I like to gather data connected to software development and visualise it to better know if applied design patterns, agreed way of working, or some particular processes are performing well or not.

Hope you will have a great today!

// Pavlo
